This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Birthday Boy

## The General Idea
Ultimately, this is an app that lets you keep track of your friends' birthdays. It lets you add, update, and delete birthdays, and even reminds you to get a gift for that person.

## Currently
Right now, the app has fairly limited functionality:
- Adds names and birthdays to a non-durable list (data will reset to static test entry when page is refreshed).
- Clicking the DELETE button on an item removes it from the list.

## Get Started
`npm start` to kick the server up to localhost.
